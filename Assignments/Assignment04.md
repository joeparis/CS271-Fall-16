**Due before the start of class on October 18**

Give an example of the use of a decoder.

Give an example of the use of a multiplexer.

Give an example of the use of a demultiplexer.

Give an example of the use of a shifter like the one in Figure 3.16 of your book.

Using Logisim and the 8-bit Ripple-Carry Adder as a starting point, build a subtractor. Hint: you will need to buid the necessary circuitry to complement the [subtrahend[(http://www.dictionary.com/browse/subtrahend?s=t).

Using Logisim, implement a parallel adder.

Using Logisim, build a 3-to-8 decoder.

In the example file I provided you I built a multiplexor capable of selecting one of four, 4-bit signals to its output. Using Logisim, build the internals of that multiplexor. 

Using Logisim, build the internals of a 1-bit, 4-channel demultiplexer.

Given the 2-bit ALU from Figure 3.17 in your text, what would have to be done to the decoder circuit to enable you to add one more function to the ALU? How would that affect the overall design of the ALU?

In the 2-bit ALU from your book (or even in a "real world" ALU), where do the signals that are presented to the decoder come from? What do they represent?
