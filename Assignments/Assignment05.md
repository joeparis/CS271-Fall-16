**Due October 20**

1. Given the function: F(x,y,z)= y(x'z + xz') + x(yz + yz')  
   a) List the truth table for F.  
   b) Draw the logic diagram using the original Boolean expression  
   c) Simplify the expression using Boolean algebra and identities.   
   d) List the truth table for your answer in Part c.  
   e) Draw the logic diagram for the simplified expression in Part c.  
2. Draw the combinational circuit that directly implements the Boolean expression:  
   F(x,y,z)= xyz + (y' + z)  
3. Draw the combinational circuit that directly implements the following Boolean expression:  
   F(x,y,z) = x + xy + y'z  
4. How many inputs does a decoder have if it has 64 outputs?  
5. How many control lines does a multiplexer have if it has 32 inputs?  
6. Assume you have the following truth tables for functions F1(x,y,z) and F2(x,y,z):  
   [![foo](http://i.imgur.com/gJfuT5Sb.png)](http://i.imgur.com/gJfuT5S.png)  
   a) Express F1 and F2 in sum-of-products form.  
   b) Simplify each function.  
   c) Draw one logic circuit to implement the above two functions.  
7.  Describe how each of the following circuits works and indicate typical inputs and outputs. Also provide a carefully labeled "black box" diagram for each.  
   a) Decoder  
   b) Multiplexer  
8. Little Susie is trying to train her new puppy. She is trying to figure out when the puppy should get a dog biscuit as a reward. She has concluded the following:  
   1. Give the puppy a biscuit if it sits and wiggles but does not bark.  
   2. Give the puppy a biscuit if it barks and wiggles but does not sit.  
   3. Give the puppy a biscuit if it sits but does not wiggle or bark.  
   4. Give the puppy a biscuit if it sits, wiggles and barks.  
   5. Don't give the puppy a treat otherwise.  
   
   Use the following:  
   
   S: Sit (0 for not sitting; 1 for sitting)  
   W: Wiggles (0 for not wiggling; 1 for wiggling)  
   B: Barking (0 for not barking; 1 for barking)  
   F: Biscuit function (0, don't give the puppy a biscuit; 1, give the puppy a biscuit)  
   
   Construct a truth table and find the minimized Boolean function to implement the logic telling Susie when to give her dog a biscuit.
   
Also, for next class review the section of your book on sequential logic.
