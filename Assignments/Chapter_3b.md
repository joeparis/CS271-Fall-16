The truth table for a Boolean expression is given below. Write the Boolean expression in SOP form.

| *x*  | *y*  | *z*  |      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 0    | 0    | 0    | 1    |
| 0    | 0    | 1    | 0    |
| 0    | 1    | 0    | 1    |
| 0    | 1    | 1    | 0    |
| 1    | 0    | 0    | 0    |
| 1    | 0    | 1    | 1    |
| 1    | 1    | 0    | 1    |
| 1    | 1    | 1    | 1    |

For each of the questions below write the full truth table for the expression as given. Then, simplify the expression showing all your work and noting the rule you used to move from one step to the next. Then, write the full truth table for the resulting, simplified expression to show its equivalence. Your goal is to implement the intent of the original expression using the fewest gates/connections possible. Be sure to express your final expression in SOP form.
   a) F(x,y) = x(x' + y)
   b) F(x,y) = x + x'y
   c) F(x,y,z) = xy + x'z + yz
   d) F(x,y) = x'(x + y) + (x + y)(x + y')
   e) F(x,y,z) = x(yz + y'z) + xy + x'y + xz
   f) F(x,y,z) = z(xy' + z)(z + y')

For each of the expressions from the question above simplify them again this time using a Kmap.
