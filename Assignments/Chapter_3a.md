** Due before the start of class on October 11 **

In your pod split into groups of at most three to discuss and answer the questions below. Be sure that *every* member of your group understands the answers you submit. The exams will be done individually. 

1. Which Boolean operation is referred to as a Boolean sum? 
2. Which Boolean operation is referred to as a Boolean product?
3. Create truth tables for the Boolean operators NOT, AND, OR, XOR, NAND, and NOR.
4. What is the Boolean duality principle?
5. Why is it important for Boolean expressions to be minimized in the design of digital circuits?
6. What is the relationship between transistors and gates?
7. What is the difference between a gate and a circuit?
8. What are the two universal gates? Why are these universal gates important?
9. Using only NAND gates, construct a NOT, OR, and AND gate.
10. Repeat number 9 this time using only NOR gates.
11. Construct truth tables for the following:
  a)  yz + z(xy)'
  b)  x(y' + z) + xyz
  c)  (x + y)(x' + y)
