**Due November 8**

1. What are the main functions of the CPU?
2. What purpose does the datapath serve?
3. What does the control unit do?
4. How is the ALU related to the CPU? What are its main functions?
5. How does the ALU know what function to perform?
6. Why is a bus often a communications bottleneck?
7. Wha is the difference between a point-to-point bus and a multipoint bus?
8. Why is a bus protocol important?
9. Explain the difference between data, address, and control busses.
10. What is a bus cycle?
11. What is the difference between synchronous and nonsynchronous busses?
12. What are the four types of bus arbitration?
13. Explain the difference between clock cycles and clock frequency. Also, explain how they are related.
14. How do system clocks and bus clocks differ?
15. Explain what the CPU should do when an interrupt occurs. Include in your answer the method the CPU uses to detect an interrupt, how it is handled, and what happens when the interrupt has been serviced.
16. How many bits would you need to address a 2M × 32 memory if   
   a) The memory is byte-addressable?   
   b) The memory is word-addressable?    
17. How many bits are required to address a 4M × 16 main memory if   
   a) Main memory is byte-addressable?   
   b) Main memory is word-addressable?   
18. Redo Example 4.1 from your book using high-order interleaving instead of low-order interleaving.
19. Suppose we have 4 memory modules instead of 8 in Figures 4.6 and 4.7. Draw the memory modules with the addresses they contain using: a) High-order Interleaving and b) Low-order interleaving.
20. How many 256x8 RAM chips are needed to provide a memory capacity of 4096 bytes?   
   a) How many bits will each address contain?   
   b) How many lines must go to each chip?   
   c) How many lines must be decoded for the chip select inputs? Specify the size of the decoder.   
21. Suppose that a 2M x 16 main memory is built using 256K × 8 RAM chips and memory is word-addressable.   
   a) How many RAM chips are necessary?   
   b) If we were accessing one full word, how many chips would be involved?   
   c) How many address bits are needed for each RAM chip?   
   d) How many banks will this memory have?   
   e) How many address bits are needed for all of memory?   
   f) If high-order interleaving is used, where would address 14 (which is E in hex) be located?   
   g) Repeat Exercise 9f for low-order interleaving.   
22. Redo Exercise 11 assuming a 16M × 16 memory built using 512K × 8 RAM chips.
  
For next class read the remainder of Chapter 4.

**Also, there *will* be a quiz up before next class.** Keep an eye out for it.
