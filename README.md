# CS271 Computer Architecture & Assembly Language #

This course introduces the basic principles of the functional organization and operation of digital computers by building a general-purpose computer system from the ground up. In the process, we will explore many ideas and techniques used in the design of modern hardware and software systems, and discuss major trade-offs and future trends. Throughout this journey, you will gain many cross-section views of the computing field, from the bare bone details of switching circuits to the high level abstraction of object-based software design (time allowing). As the quarter progresses, you should gain an understanding of what is actually happening "under-the-hood" of your computer (don't worry, you are in no danger of being assimilated into the collective).

## Prerequisite ##

CS161 Introduction to Computer Science I (Java)

## Class Policies ##

This quarter represents the inaugural offering of this class in the new Innovation Classroom (MKH-203). In honor of this we will be experimenting with "flipping the class" in order to make best use of the technologies and opportunities afforded us by the room. This will require extra diligence on all our parts, especially you the learner. Assignments given in preparation for class may include various readings or watching of videos *must be completed before class*. Coming to class prepared to engage in the discussion, either large- or small-group, is crucial to your success in this class.

Students come from many different backgrounds and have unique life experiences which can enhance class discussions. For this reason, it is crucial for students to share their insights on course-related topics. Current issues involving course- and subject-related matters will be very much a part of the class and I encourage you to come to class ready to share new information and ask questions. Students are expected to be prepared for each class, having completed all reading and homework assignments. The course is extremely cumulative so a good start is essential.

While in class, please set your cell phone to *vibrate*. If you need to take a call, please step out of the room to do so. 

## Assignments ##

Homework assignments may include completing designated readings or viewings, individual homework problems, lab activities, and individual or group projects. Homework is designed to enhance your understanding of key concepts and materials. Thoroughly reading, studying, and practicing each assignment is highly recommended.

It is recommended that you use the computers in Library Computer Lab on the Albany campus, the Benton Center Computer Lab (BC225) or the Benton Learning Center (BC222), the Lebanon Center Computer Lab (LC219), or in McKenzie Hall  
labs when they are available. Alternately, you may use your own personal computers provided it has the required software installed.

Assignments are due at the *beginning* of class on the due date unless otherwise specified. Late assignments will not be accepted, no exceptions.

Assignments may not be submitted via e-mail.

Written assignments must be word processed and spell- and grammar-checked.


## Exams ##
There will be a midterm and a cumulative final given for the course. The final exam will be given during the [normally scheduled final exam time](https://www.linnbenton.edu/finals-schedule) for the class.

## Assessment
Grades will be determined according to the following schedule:

| Type | Weight |
| ---- | ------ |
| Assignments | 50% |
| Midterm | 25% |
| Final | 25% |

| Score | Grade |
| ----- | ----- |
| 90 – 100% | A |
| 80 – 89% | B |
| 70 – 79% | C |
| 60 – 69% | D |
| < 60% | F |

No grades of Y, W, WP or Inc will be given in this class. Remember, if you decide not to complete the course is it *your* responsibility to withdraw from it. It is not the instructor's responsibility to drop you. More information about these grades and how they can impact both your financial aid and your overall progress as a student can be found on the [Academic Standards For Financial Aid page](http://www.linnbenton.edu/current-students/money-matters/financial-aid/academic-standards-for-financial-aid/academic-standards-for-financial-aid-continued).

## Academic Honesty ##

Helping, or being helped by, another student during an exam will be considered a breach of academic honesty and is grounds for receiving a zero grade and/or failing the course among other possible remedies as outlined in the [Students' Rights and Responsibilities Handbook](https://www.linnbenton.edu/current-students/administration-information/policies/students-rights-responsibilities-and-conduct).

## LBCC Center for Accessibility Resources ##

The [Center for Accessibility Resources (CFAR)](https://linnbenton.edu/cfar) provides reasonable accommodations, academic adjustments and auxiliary aids to ensure that qualified students with disabilities have access to classes, programs and events at Linn-Benton Community College. Students are responsible for requesting accommodations in a timely manner. To receive appropriate and timely accommodations from LBCC, please give the Center for Accessibility Resources as much advance notice of your disability and specific needs as possible, as certain accommodations such as sign language interpreting take days to weeks to have in place. Contact the Disability Coordinator at Linn-Benton Community College, RCH-105, 6500 Pacific Blvd. SW, Albany, Oregon 97321, Phone 541-917-4789 or via Oregon Telecommunications Relay TTD at 1-800-735-2900 or 1-800-735-1232. LBCC is an equal opportunity educator and employer.
