# CS271 Computer Architecture & Assembly Language #

## Course Description ##

This course introduces the basic principles of the functional organization and operation of digital computers by building a general-purpose computer system from the ground up. In the process, we will explore many ideas and techniques used in the design of modern hardware and software systems, and discuss major trade-offs and future trends. Throughout this journey, you will gain many cross-section views of the computing field, from the bare bone details of switching circuits to the high level abstraction of object-based software design (time allowing). As the quarter progresses, you should gain an understanding of what is actyally happening "under-the-hood" of your computer (don't worry, you are in no danger of being assimilated into the collective).
