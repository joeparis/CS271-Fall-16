	* It's time we confessed: the floating point representation you learned about in CS160 was a lie. Computers today have standardized on the IEEE 754 representation of floating point values. [This video](https://youtu.be/yh2m7BSzRRo) tells you the ugly truth about floating point.
	* And here's an online

Oh noes! MATHS!!! We'll be revving up and refreshing a lot of material from Chapter 2.

We may even start to refresh some basic Boolean materials as time permits. 

**Before class on October 4**
* Read Chapter 3. It can be a bit dry, plan your time accordingly and remember, it's *critical* that you do the reading *before* class.
* Here are some optional videos covering much of the material from sections 3.1 â€“ 3.5
	* [Boolean Algebra OR AND NOT Logic Gates](https://youtu.be/iStLeNIZ6Pg)
	* [Boolean Algebra NOR and NAND Logic Gates](https://youtu.be/qUio80-zcIU)
	* [Boolean Algebra Logic Circuit Simplification](https://youtu.be/JqhaPnJGe7g)
* You may want to download [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) and get familiar with it. We will be using it in class to explore Boolean algebra, functions, and digital logic. At a minimum I suggest running through the beginner's tutorial in help (feel free to go deeper). 
* Complete the [pre-class quiz](https://goo.gl/forms/LvitD7pdVzAEb4jI2)

## October 4
Boolean Algebra and Digital Logic
* Boolean Algebra
